# Employee Attrition:

The aim of this exploratory data analysis is to identify causes of both employee attrition as well as retention using a dataset of 1300 anonymized HR files
 

The key results are that:

* Overtime has the strongest impact

* But generally, factors associated with youth and mobility, like unmarried, low job level etc. also noteworthy

* However, both soft, like consistency and hard factors, like payment are in the top 10 causes

* Notably employees are less likely or willing to churn as age or time at the company increases

* With a notable short term decrease in attrition around the age of 40

* But attrition is still far more likely if income is on the lower end of the age~pay scale
